## Most folder contain the files
- `compute_data.py`: script used to compute stuff
- `load_data.py`: code to load the data
- Data tequila needs to read in the molecules
  - `NAME_htensor.npy`: one-body integrals 
  - `NAME_gtensor.npy`: two-body integrals 
  - `NAME_pnoinfo.txt`: information about orbitals computed by madness
- Additional info:
  - `input`: original madness input file generated by tequila
  - `NAME_pno_integrals.out`: mandness output file (contains runtimes and more information - most of the time not important)
